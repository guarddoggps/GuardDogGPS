    <p><span id="textmoto">I have an alarm system sign outside my home to deter thieves. Why isn’t there the same information on m	y Guard Dog GPS device?</span><br />
  Experience shows tracking devices themselves are not good theft deterrents.  Their value is in fast tracking and recovery of your car by police, before the vehicle is stripped of parts or shipped out of the country.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
<p><span id="textmoto">Is one tracker usable for all types of vehicles?</span><br />
  A: We design and manufacture proprietary Guard Dog GPS devices specifically for cars, vehicle fleets, motorcycles and marine environments.  <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Wåhat is bread crumbing?</span><br />
  Our devices provide daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly detailed vehicle travel histories for you to analyze later. Reports show routes, speeds, stops with addresses, whether the engine was left running and for how long, mileage and other information. The data will help you save fuel and maintenance costs, increase productivity, improve safety and provide insights into field activity that can improve overall efficiency.  <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Can I get a discount from my insurance company if I have a Guard Dog GPS in my vehicle?</span><br />
  Yes, insurance companies see the value in recovering a stolen vehicle quickly and undamaged. They are willing to encourage their customers to install an engine kill switch, a Guard Dog option, as an incentive for a discount of 10 to 25 percent.  <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Am I invading my child’s privacy by tracking her driving?</span><br />
  Rewarding good driving habits in teens and young adults is positive reinforcement. A teenager is more likely to die in an automobile-related accident than an adult, and a feature like a panic alarm is indispensible for personal security.  <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    How often does the software need to be updated?</span><br />
  Guard Dog GPS programmers are continually writing new code and sending free updates over the air, so you can be assured you will always have the latest features. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    What happens if my vehicle is stolen and hidden in a building or blocked, so that the clear sky signal is degraded?</span><br />
  The signal is automatically switched to cell phone triangulation for continuous tracking. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Can I terminate my service agreement at any time?</span><br />
  Guard Dog service plans have no contracts or early cancellation penalty, just one low yearly flat rate with no hassles. Monthly payment plans are also available. <br />
   <br />
  <span id="textmoto">Do you use GPS components from the Orient?</span><br />
  Our commitment to quality is total. We specify and install only components from the highest-rated multi-national companies.] <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    If my car battery is disconnected, will the device still work?</span><br />
  Your Guard Dog GPS is equipped with its own rechargeable back-up battery. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    What is a virtual fence?</span><br />
  You can set an area as small as half a city block or as large as an entire state or larger where you want the vehicle to operate. As soon as the vehicle goes outside that boundary, you receive an immediate alert sent to your hand-held device or computer. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Does Guard Dog GPS come with a guarantee?</span><br />
  Yes, we are so confident in our design and manufacturing that we have a two-year, full replacement guarantee. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Is there a panic button?</span><br />
  Yes, safety and security is our main concern. All Guard Dog GPS devices have an optional panic button and alert that can be installed.  <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    How does the optional panic button work?</span><br />
  With the optional panic button installed an alert can be sent if you feel your security is being threatened. A standard feature of all Guard Dog GPS devices is an alert that is sent if the vehicle is involved in an accident or there is an emergency. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Will I save money using a Guard Dog GPS?</span><br />
  In addition to saving on your insurance, you can improve your MPG, maintenance costs and vehicle wear and tear. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    What type of vehicle is best suited for a Guard Dog GPS tracking and security device?</span><br />
  Guard Dog GPS designs proprietary tracking and security devices for cars, fleets. motorcycles and marine environments. Any vehicle, from cars to giant earth movers should be protected with a Guard Dog GPS. In addition, Guard Dog GPS can customize applications to meet your safety security and reporting requirements. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Are MotoTrac and MarineTrac units water resistant or waterproof?</span><br />
  All MotoTrac and MarineTrac units are enclosed in a waterproof case to keep them from being harmed by salt or fresh water. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    What are your service plan rates?</span><br />
  We have no contracts, so there are no &quot;gotcha&quot; usage charges. There are no early termination fees either, just one low yearly discounted rate for all our devices. If you prefer, you can opt for our convenient monthly plan. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    How are the devices installed?</span><br />
  Your local auto stereo installer can install Guard Dog GPS, including any of our several optional functions. If you are moderately garage savvy, installation is a snap because these are only two wires to connect. The device uploads automatically after you register online. <br />
   <br />
  <span id="textmoto">Where are the devices made?</span><br />
  We proudly design and manufacture our proprietary Guard Dog GPS units in the U.S.A. at our world headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    What do you mean by proprietary devices?</span><br />
  Because of our unyielding commitment to quality, Guard Dog GPS engineers start from the beginning and design all the hardware. We manufacture the devices at our Fort Lauderdale headquarters using the finest components from world-wide suppliers. The operating software is also developed by our in-house programming staff. Many of our competitors purchase complete devices from one supplier and software from another. Then they put their label on the device, and sell it to the public. <br />
  <span id="textmoto"><br />
    Does Guard Dog GPS sell my information to the police?</span><br />
  All the data collected by your device is your property and Guard Dog GPS will not release this information to anyone. </p>
