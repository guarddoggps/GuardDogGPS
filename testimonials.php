    <p>&quot;I found Guard Dog GPS online when needing a reliable GPS tracking device for my wife's car. I purchased AutoTrac on Friday afternoon and they had it delivered on Monday. Guard Dog GPS was extremely responsive with all my questions, and their online software was extremely easy to learn.  This company stands out among others with its innovative solutions. Thanks again!&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;I purchased a Guard Dog GPS MotoTrac device several months ago. The product's purchase was incredibly easy through their website, upon arrival, all I had to do was install it on my motorcycle and activate it online. The website was easy to use and always very up to date. The charges for the service are reasonable and the quality of service is outstanding! I will continue to use Guard Dog GPS services for all my personal as well as business tracking needs.&quot;<br />

    <p>&quot;I utilize the Guard Dog GPS AutoTrac device to assist tracking my teen driver, this allows me to validate their whereabouts as well as obeying to speed limits, and to honor our agreement of having driving privileges.&quot;<br />

    <p>&quot;We have been utilizing Guard Dog GPS FleetTrac for several months. Our initial test worked so well that we are implementing your system throughout our entire branch network. Not only have we been able to demonstrate cost savings but the system has increased the safety factor of our drivers.&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;We are very happy with Guard Dog GPS tracking devices. They help keep track of employees and the freight they are carrying with the added benefit of clearing up any discrepancies with customers regarding time of delivery. FleetTrac was extremely easy to setup, and the cost per vehicle is extremely affordable compare to other companies. Thank you Guard Dog GPS for your great products&quot;<br />

    <p>&quot;AutoTrac has helped us keep a tighter control over my teen movements. Using your online software I was able to check on their normal routes, making sure they were getting to school, on time and without distractions. Speed control and virtual fence features were a deal breaker for us; we make sure both our kids respect speed limits, and they drive within our city line. Thank you Guard Dog GPS!&quot;<br />

    <p>&quot;Good afternoon, first of all, let me say that I purchased your unit, a little scared though about the hype, and have been more than pleasantly surprised and satisfied. Installation was a breeze. It took less than 45 minutes total. The directions were very accurate and thorough. As soon as I had it installed, I got on the computer and it worked exactly as it was described. Love the ease of use application with speed control, virtual fence, and remote control of my new new SUV. This Guard Dog GPS AutoTrac is a winner!!&quot;<br />

    <p>&quot;When I purchased  my new Stingray 225, the dealer suggested me Guard Dog GPS MarineTrac. I was blown away by the online demo, and the price was really affordable. Now I have a peace of mind every time I dock my boat for a while.&quot;<br />
